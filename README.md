# Diabetes-and-Coronary-Heart-Disease-Risk-Factors

## Measurements of Coronary Heart Disease risk factors were collected on black Virginia residents between 1992 and 1993. Using linear discriminant analysis and MANOVA tests on a dataset of 403 observations, we found that diabetic status was tied to many of these CHD risk factors. MANOVA tests indicated that mean vectors for several quantitative risk factors are non-homogenous across diabetic, pre-diabetic, and non-diabetic subjects. Using linear discriminant analysis, we also found that all quantitative CHD risk factors can be used to correctly classify subjects in 92.57% of tested cases. However, the classification rule was prone to false negatives, and, as such, should not be relied upon for diagnosing diabetes. Data contained several observations with missing risk factor values, so a future study with a more complete dataset of a similar size could yield more reliable results and allow for even deeper analysis.
